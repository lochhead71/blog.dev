			<div id="me_desc">
				<p>My career experience is varied, but complimentary, having taught me multiple strategies for communicating a core message to a target demographic.</p>
				<p>In the early part of my career, working in the non-profit advocacy sector, I was equally comfortable reaching out to a disenfranchised minority population as serving in a legislative working group striving to craft policy for early childhood education.</p>
				<p>During my tenure at a statewide industry trade association, my audience spanned from communicating the benefits of check fraud deterrent programs to the banking public, to creating presentations for Texas’ leading bankers at the annual convention.</p>
				<p>My dozen years  with the Business Journals has built a foundation of understanding for what the business leaders in Texas’ major cities look for in strategic intelligence, and how newsrooms pursue and develop business news that shape the conversation for economic development.</p>
